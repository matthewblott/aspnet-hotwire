ASP.NET using Hotwire with Vite working example

Run the following commands:

```bash
cd ClientApp
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Then execute the main program using either ```dotnet run``` or from an appropriate IDE.

The Notes example uses Hotwire and the Todos example uses Turbo Streams with SignalR.
